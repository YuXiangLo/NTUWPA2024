## 1. Branching Strategy
- **Main Branch (`main`)**: Always remains stable and deployable.
- **Feature Branches (`feature/{name}`)**: Used for new features or changes.
- **Bug Fix Branches (`fix/{name}`)**: Used for fixing bugs.
- **Refactor Branches (`refactor/{name}`)**: Used for code structures refactor.

## 2. Commit Guidelines
- Use clear and concise commit messages.
- Follow this commit message structure:
- **Types**:
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation update
  - `style`: Code style (formatting, no logic changes)
  - `refactor`: Code refactoring (no behavior change)
  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore`: Maintenance or tooling changes

- Example commit:
  ```
  feat: Add user authentication
  Implement JWT-based authentication and user session management.
  ```

## 3. Pull Request (PR) Process
- Always create a PR before merging to `main`.
- PR titles should be descriptive and follow the format:
- Add a summary of changes in the PR description.
- Assign at least one reviewer.
- Ensure tests pass before requesting a review.
- Reference related issues with `Fixes #issue_number`.

## 4. Code Review Guidelines
- Be constructive and respectful in feedback.
- Use inline comments for specific code suggestions.
- Request changes if necessary but provide a reason.
- The PR can be merged only after approval from at least one reviewer.

## 5. Merging Policy
- Do not use **squash and merge**.
- Only maintainers can merge to `main`.
- Ensure all CI checks pass before merging.

## 6. Handling Conflicts
- Resolve conflicts locally before pushing.
- Use `git rebase` to keep the commit history clean.
- If rebasing is too complex, use `git merge` instead.

## 7. Best Practices
- Keep branches small and focused.
- Commit frequently but meaningfully.
- Regularly pull the latest changes from `main`.
- Communicate actively with the team.
